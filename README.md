This is a challenge to create a pixel perfect and interactive landing page using modern HTML5, CSS and ES6 javascript

## Overview

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create a fully responsive, SEO friendly, accessable landing page in HTML5
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Implement the design using the [styleguide](style-guide.md)
- Use the mobile and desktop designs provided in the designs directory
- Basic text has already been provided in the index.html

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS transitions for interactive elements
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

## Using GIT

- Each PXL Hero must create his or her own branch in this repository: block1_{your-name-here}
- You are of course free to create local feature branches during development but we want to see 1 remote branch with your final solution
- Please commit often and with good commit messages

## Tip

- Use the lighthouse feature in the developer tools in Chrome to test your design
